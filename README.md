# Irving Ju√°rez - Fullstack Engineer
I am a FullStack developer with experience with React, Python and Node.js. I started learning about tech since 2020 when I quit school and started learning about web development.

I have been working as freelance for a while until I got into a multinational company where I have been working with an international team, developing a web platform for a Canadian Bank

My goals for the future is specialize myself as a data scientist while working as fullstack developer. As well I would like to fund a startup, so I am always learning about tech or about finances/enterprises
